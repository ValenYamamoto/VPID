# VPID
some vpid thoughts
Well weird things happened and i got this equation

double val = Math.sqrt((y*y)*(1-(i*i)/(x*x)));
		val = val * (x*Math.sqrt(1-(i*i)/(x*x))+Math.asin(i/x));
		val = val/(Math.sqrt(1-(i*i)/(x*x)));
   
To try and simulate some kind of velocity based motor control for both smooth curves and otherwise regular driving.
